MalwareGuard
MalwareGuard Pro is an advanced security model designed to check PE files for potential threats. It uses a three-step method: first, it uses Yara Rules to spot known malware patterns; then, it relies on SSDEEP Hashing to spot similar files, even if slightly changed. Lastly, it uses the Boosted Random Forest Algorithm to tell if files are bad or safe. MalwareGuard Pro enhances security by carefully analyzing files, ensuring your system stays safe.
